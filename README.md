The purpose of this assignment was to practice building a basic React app, applying what we've learned about React hooks - useEffect and UseState - and React Router.

### What I've learned...
- How to organize my page site structure via React Routes
- How to navigate the site using Link and Navigate
- How to use Layout and Output components in combination with Route components
- (Beyond the scope of our lessons) How to use useContext for shared access to data

### Where I need improvement...
- Testing, testing and ...testing
- Breaking down repeated elements into reusable components instead
- A better organization of styles

### Future Add-Ons/Features
- A more responsive layout
- A quick cart preview upon adding item to cart
- A better, more fleshed-out homepage (and so I can remove those tacky images...)
